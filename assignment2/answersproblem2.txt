  The variance of the i-th principle component is the i-th eigenvalue obtained
  by the formula: l_i = (s_i)^2 / N; Where li is the eigenvalue, s_i is the
  i-th singular value and N is the number of points in the dataset.
  Projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace of the originial sample
  set is equivalent to a linear transformation C being applied to the data. The
  resultant lower dimensional space represents the data as points under an
  orthonormal basis. This means that the data in the new subspace is not
  linearly interdependent. This is equivalent to a diagonal covariance matrix.
